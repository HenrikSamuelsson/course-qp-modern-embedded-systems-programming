# Lesson 00 - Getting Started

## About the Course

The course is called Embedded Systems Programming. Will when taking the course learn how to program embedded microcontrollers in C. The man behind the course is Miro Samek.

## Processor Family

The hardware used in the course is based on the processor family ARM Cortex-M4F.

## Tool Set

The development tool set used in the course is Embedded Workbench for ARM (EWARM). A commercial tool provided by the company IAR Systems. This tool set comes in a size limited evaluation version.

I personally will use a full version since the company which I work have bought a license which I can use.

## Development Kit

A dedicated hardware in the form of a development kit is required if to follow through all the way with all the documents in the course. The kit chosen for the course is is based on the inexpensive and widely available EK-TM4C123GXL board from Texas Instruments, also known under the name TivaC LaunchPad.

I personally happened to have this kit available at home already, lets hope it is still functional.
